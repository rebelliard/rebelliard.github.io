I had been interested in sharing with the community for quite some time, but the opportunity finally presented itself when <a href="https://www.facebook.com/leonardoajim">Leonardo</a> -the leader of our local software development communities- suggested a talk on Python or Django.</p>\n<p><img src="/public/images/blog/2016-06-13/fb-leo.png" alt="Leo proposes a talk!"></p>\n<p>I immediately felt the rush to decline until I stopped myself and thought: ”<strong>Hey</strong>, why not?”, and promptly agreed to do so. Despite my interest in public speaking due to my admiration for <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/">great speakers</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTuElM6T50w">stand-up comedians</a>, I’m a person that naturally shies away from the limelight, so just by making the decision to share my knowledge, I already felt myself learning from the experience.</p>\n<p>For the next few weeks, I started reading about “content and delivery” and watching conferences from Django Migration’s creator <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewgodwin">Andrew Goodwin</a>, jotting notes and quite frankly, learning way more than I could have imagined.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to the event itself, it was <em>so</em> much fun. We had a low turn-out which was perfect because it helped the few us there have a conversational tone and focus strictly on the topics that interested the group the most, while at the same time, being more manageable to me.</p>\n<p>Man, I can’t wait to do it again.</p>\n<div>\n          <div\n            class="gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper"\n            style="padding-bottom: 81.5126050420168%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 1.0725rem"\n          >\n            <iframe src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/rI3XDNnl4AGgJX" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen style="\n            position: absolute;\n            top: 0;\n            left: 0;\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 100%;\n          "> </iframe>\n          </div>\n          </div>',frontmatter:{title:"Thoughts on giving my first tech talk",date:"June 13, 2016",permalink:"/blog/thoughts-on-giving-my-first-tech-talk"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/blog/thoughts-on-giving-my-first-tech-talk",previous:{fields:{slug:"/blog/managing-front-end-components-with-bower"},frontmatter:{title:"Managing front end components with Bower",teaser:null,description:"Learn the basics of maintaining your third-party assets using the Bower package manager.",tags:["javascript"],redirectFrom:["/managing-front-end-components-with-bower/"],disableListing:null}},next:{fields:{slug:"/blog/how-do-i-become-a-better-developer"},frontmatter:{title:"How do I become a better developer?",teaser:"Start a blog.",description:"How I can break away from my plateau and improve my coding skills?",tags:["growth"],redirectFrom:["/how-do-i-become-a-better-developer/"],disableListing:null}}}}}});

Yesterday, I shared [how concerned](react-driven-by-facebook-principle-concerns) I was with React's
[Design Principles](https://facebook.github.io/react/contributing/design-principles.html).
Today, I'd like to share the response I received from [@dan_abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov)
‚Äîa member of the React team‚Äî regarding my interpretation of these principles.

I hope this helps anyone who felt as conflicted as I did.

## Response

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/rebelliard">@rebelliard</a> That Facebook heavily uses React in production (unlike Parse) is exactly why I think community can bet on it.</p>&mdash; Dan Abramov (@dan_abramov) <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/754278530817617921">July 16, 2016</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/rebelliard">@rebelliard</a> So on the contrary, I think you should have been concerned if Facebook didn&#39;t use React and maintained it for image purposes üòâ</p>&mdash; Dan Abramov (@dan_abramov) <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/754279261805109248">July 16, 2016</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/rebelliard">@rebelliard</a> There is also some sort of misunderstanding here.

I thank [@dan_abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov) for taking the time to clarify what they meant.
It certainly didn't occur to me that they kept an ear to the ground and I could _just ask_,
which gives me a sense of relief and quite frankly, makes me **even more** interested
in the library than I previously was.

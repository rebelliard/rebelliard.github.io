Over the past few years, I've been building modern web applications using the
[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) framework.
Despite my interest in this framework, I've always paid close attention to [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and other less popular frameworks.
It's important to point out that these frameworks are not competing with each other, but rather,
they are tackling the same problem -making the web great again- from different angles.

## A close look at the worldwide interest in client-side frameworks

[![Worldwide](/public/images/blog/2016-07-01/trends-worldwide.png)](https://www.google.com/trends/explore#cat=0-5-31&q=%2Fm%2F0j45p7w%2C%20%2Fm%2F012l1vxv%2C%20%2Fm%2F0t545zt&date=1%2F2014%2029m&cmpt=q&tz=Etc%2FGMT%2B4)

According to [Google Trends](https://www.google.com/trends/), we can see
that the interest in AngularJS is overwhelming in regards to the rest of the pack.
I was quite surprised with these results given how over the past two years, based on
the communities I'm a part of, I would have thought the divide was narrower.

At this point, I'm surprised that the push React receives from major applications
such as Facebook, Netflix and Airbnb haven't made it the top framework in terms of interest.

This also left me wondering if this trend repeated itself by region, so I changed
the scope of my research to specific countries. Let's find out.

### United States

[![United States](/public/images/blog/2016-07-01/trends-us.png)](https://www.google.com/trends/explore#cat=0-5-31&q=%2Fm%2F0j45p7w%2C%20%2Fm%2F012l1vxv%2C%20%2Fm%2F0t545zt&geo=US&date=1%2F2014%2029m&cmpt=q&tz=Etc%2FGMT%2B4)

The worldwide trend is very representative of the interest within the United States.
If anything, we can see a slight bump in attention to both React and MeteorJS.

### United Kingdom

[![United Kingdom](/public/images/blog/2016-07-01/trends-uk.png)](https://www.google.com/trends/explore#cat=0-5-31&q=%2Fm%2F0j45p7w%2C%20%2Fm%2F012l1vxv%2C%20%2Fm%2F0t545zt&geo=GB&date=1%2F2014%2029m&cmpt=q&tz=Etc%2FGMT%2B4)

Europe presents similar trends to those previously seen, albeit React shows
a less linear increase than the United States. Let's take a look at Asia.

### Japan

[![Japan](/public/images/blog/2016-07-01/trends-jp.png)](https://www.google.com/trends/explore#cat=0-5-31&q=%2Fm%2F0j45p7w%2C%20%2Fm%2F012l1vxv%2C%20%2Fm%2F0t545zt&geo=JP&date=1%2F2014%2029m&cmpt=q&tz=Etc%2FGMT%2B4)

Whoa, React has really taken off in the asian market. Even though AngularJS is still
the most looked into framework of the two, the difference is much less dramatic than
in America and Europe, to the point where on April of 2016, they were pretty much neck and neck!

Around this time, it's clear that AngularJS got catapulted again when [version 2.0](https://www.sitepoint.com/whats-new-in-angularjs-2/)
started to show [signs of maturity](http://thenewstack.io/google-preps-angular-2-final-release/),
but despite React not having a similar overhaul, it's been creeping in at a steady pace.

### China

[![Japan](/public/images/blog/2016-07-01/trends-cn.png)](https://www.google.com/trends/explore#cat=0-5-31&q=%2Fm%2F0j45p7w%2C%20%2Fm%2F012l1vxv%2C%20%2Fm%2F0t545zt&geo=CN&date=1%2F2014%2029m&cmpt=q&tz=Etc%2FGMT%2B4)

Well, hello React a.k.a. Mr. Top Dog. Although the difference is less greater than other regions,
the trend clearly shows that React isn't slowing down anytime soon. Why is React that much popular
in Asia? I'm pleasantly surprised.

## What does this mean?

Regardless of what your preference is, one thing is certain:
the software development world has embraced client-side frameworks. If you plan on
building applications with a rich user experience for the very demanding users we now have,
you better start learning one of these major frameworks.

* [AngularJS](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/).
* [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html).
* [MeteorJS](https://guide.meteor.com/).

They all have different scopes, so make sure you take a look at all of them
before making your decision!

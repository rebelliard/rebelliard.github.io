On may 25th, I had the opportunity of giving my first ever talk during the event [Python Dominicana 059](https://www.facebook.com/events/1787153718174739/). I had been interested in sharing with the community for quite some time, but the opportunity finally presented itself when [Leonardo](https://www.facebook.com/leonardoajim) -the leader of our local software development communities- suggested a talk on Python or Django.

I immediately felt the rush to decline until I stopped myself and thought: "**Hey**, why not?", and promptly agreed to do so. Despite my interest in public speaking due to my admiration for [great speakers](http://www.hanselman.com/) and [stand-up comedians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTuElM6T50w), I'm a person that naturally shies away from the limelight, so just by making the decision to share my knowledge, I already felt myself learning from the experience.

For the next few weeks, I started reading about "content and delivery" and watching conferences from Django Migration's creator [Andrew Goodwin](https://twitter.com/andrewgodwin), jotting notes and quite frankly, learning way more than I could have imagined.

Fast forward to the event itself, it was _so_ much fun. We had a low turn-out which was perfect because it helped the few us there have a conversational tone and focus strictly on the topics that interested the group the most, while at the same time, being more manageable to me.

Man, I can't wait to do it again.
